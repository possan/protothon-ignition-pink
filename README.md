"Ignition" by "Pink"
====================

This is our contribution to the protothon spotify apps hackathon

It consists of three different parts:

1. Message routing backend using node.js

2. Spotify app backend (without design) that keeps track of scores and which side (if any) should win the next round.

3. A fullscreen processing frontend which uses the camera to look for motion on either side of the room, more motion equals more score and a better chance of their (from a list of good songs) randomly picked song beeing played next. if no team interacts enough with the camera a random penalty song is played from the "bad" playlist for 15 seconds... (usually a justin bieber song)
